# Application-centric Connectivity demo
{: #skupper_demo}

## Description

This demo illustrates how a deployed application can be automatically connected to remote resources, and then how that connectivity can follow the application as it moves to other locations without downtime by creating a Virtual Application Network (VAN).  Those connections are not intra-cluster or intra-sub-net connectivity, but also includes inter-cluster and inter-cloud connectivity.

## Use Cases

1. Using CI/CD automation to connect deployed applications to remote services
2. Moving a network overlay to a new location without disrupting an application's connectivity
3. Showing application connectivity resilliency in the face of a network segment going down
4. Enabling application mobility
