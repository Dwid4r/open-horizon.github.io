When the {{site.data.keyword.horizon}} agent runs your service containers on an edge node, it provides useful data in the form of environment variables. For more information, including a detailed list of these variables and the values that you can expect find for the variables, see [{{site.data.keyword.horizon}} service environment variables ](/docs/anax/docs/managed_workloads/#service-environment-variables).
