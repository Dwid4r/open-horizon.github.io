# Installing edge nodes
{: #installing_edge_nodes}

Edge computing places enterprise applications closer to where the data is created, and where actions need to be taken. More importantly, the negotiation, agreement, execution, and validation of management actions is autonomously carried out between the {{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} ({{site.data.keyword.ieam}}) hub and each edge endpoint that is running a lightweight agent. This autonomous management is a new form of management that addresses the scale, variability, and rate of change of edge topologies including edge nodes: devices and clusters, edge gateways, and network edges.

Typically, edge devices have a prescriptive purpose, provide (often limited) compute capabilities, and are located near or at the data source. Edge clusters usually run workloads in remote, sometimes disconnected, locations near the data source (outside of a data center or cloud environment).

For more information about installing the required software for {{site.data.keyword.edge_notm}} for nodes, see:
